Independent notes

July 11, 2017

- Working on the AP_assistant to handle non-parallel systems.

- Site dependencies were moved to ap_system_dependencies.pm

- AP_assistant should refuse to start a project if the current directory is
  where the code is located. This is a very common mistake made by
  everyone, including me!
- AP_assistant should also double check that its path is part of $PATH

- AP_assistant should keep it as simple as possible, and when called
  without arguments it should 
    a) Create the .automatedProcessing file if it doesn't exist and exit
    b) Create a sample bare-bone file with some basic information for the
       user to follow.
    c) No attempt should be made to create a '.td' or '.tm' file

- AP_assistant should be able to create a sample '.tm' if so requested by
  the user using a command line argument
    AP_assistant -create_sample_tm

- AP_assistant should also give a usage syntax description
